/**
 * URLs of a document computed by javascript in a real browser.
 *
 * URLs and location properties in the browser:
 *
 * In the Document Object Model (DOM), the relationship between `document.URL`, `document.documentURI`,
 * `document.location`, and the URL displayed in the browser's address bar is as follows:
 * 1. `document.URL`:
 *    - This property returns the URL of the document as a string.
 *    - It is a read-only property and reflects the current URL of the document.
 *    - Changes to `document.location` will also update `document.URL`.
 * 2. `document.documentURI`:
 *    - This property returns the URI of the document.
 *    - It is also a read-only property and typically contains the same value as `document.URL`.
 *    - However, `document.documentURI` is defined to be the URI that was provided to the parser, which could
 *      potentially differ from `document.URL` in certain cases, although in practice, this is rare.
 * 3. `document.location`:
 *    - This property represents the location (URL) of the current page and allows you to manipulate the URL.
 *    - It is a read-write property, which means you can change it to navigate to a different page or to manipulate
 *      query strings, fragments, etc.
 *    - Changes to `document.location` will cause the browser to navigate to the new URL, updating both `document.URL`
 *      and the URL displayed in the address bar.
 * 4. URL displayed in the address bar:
 *    - The URL displayed in the browser's address bar is what users see and can edit directly.
 *    - It is typically synchronized with `document.URL` and `document.location.href` (a property of `document.location`).
 *    - When the page is loaded or when `document.location` is modified, the address bar is updated to reflect the new URL.
 * In summary, `document.URL` and `document.documentURI` are read-only properties that reflect the current URL of the
 * document, while `document.location` is a read-write property that not only reflects the current URL but also allows
 * you to navigate to a new one. The URL displayed in the address bar is a user-facing representation of the current
 * document's URL, which is usually in sync with `document.location`.
